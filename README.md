# xHM
cross-scale hydrological model
## Sub-routines
### Receiving radiation (snow surface)
Based on meteorological variable to derive receiving shortwave and longwave radiation on 
the surface of snowpack.


### Snow model
physically-based snow accumulation and melting model


## Main processes
- canopy interception
- snow accumulation and melting
- soil moisture dynamics
- infiltration and surface runoff
- evapotranspiration
- subsurface storage and discharge generation
- deep percolation and baseflow
- discharge attenuation 
- flood routing

## To-Do-List
- test snow model for other stations (areas), more test studies
- test the parameter sensitivity
- test hourly scale snow modeling 

- split the functions into more independent source code files
- give more, detailed explanation for each function,as much as possible 
- give each source code file a signature
- "constants.h"
- how to describe the relationship among different source code files, put it at the beginning of each source code file
- header (& source code) files for initializing the state (hydrological processes)
- header (& source code) files for data input 
- header (& source code) files for look-up table 
-
