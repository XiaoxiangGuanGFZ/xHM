# xHM
cross-scale hydrological model
## Sub-routines
### Receiving radiation (snow surface)
Based on meteorological variable to derive receiving shortwave and longwave radiation on 
the surface of snowpack.


### Snow model
physically-based snow accumulation and melting model


## Main processes
- canopy interception
- snow accumulation and melting
- soil moisture dynamics
- infiltration and surface runoff
- evapotranspiration
- subsurface storage and discharge generation
- deep percolation and baseflow
- discharge attenuation 
- flood routing

## To-Do-List
- test snow model for other stations (areas), more test studies
- test the parameter sensitivity
- test hourly scale snow modeling
