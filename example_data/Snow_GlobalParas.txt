# WINSD: wind speed, m/s
# TEM_AIR_AVG: average daily air temperature, celsius degree
# SUNDUR: sunshine duration, hours
# use the keyword SKIP, in case that column is useless:
#	for example, VAR,SKIP
VAR,YEAR
VAR,MONTH
VAR,DAY
VAR,PREC #mm
VAR,WINSD #m/s

#* unit conversion: MJ/m2/d = 1000/24 (kJ/m2/h)
#* if modelling daily processes, STEP = 24; 
#*      then the unit should be MJ/m2/d in the weather input data file;
#* if STEP = 1 or 2 hours,
#*      then the unit should be carefully converted during input preparation
